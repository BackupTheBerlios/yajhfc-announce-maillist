Subject: [Yajhfc-announce] YajHFC 0.5.0beta2
Message-ID: <201101091434.07132.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

A new beta version for YajHFC 0.5.0 has been made available today.

You can find it in the following directory:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/beta/

In addition to the previous beta (for details see 
http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/yajhfc-announce/2010/000032.html ), this 
version incorporates the following changes:

- Support for multiple servers

- Support for multiple identities


Since both are rather large changes at the "core" of the program, this beta 
might contain all kinds of new bugs (i.e. you should not use in in a 
production environment without a thorough test).

Nevertheless, everybody is encouraged to test this new version and report any 
bugs, possible improvements, etc. he or she finds.
(BTW, if you find it stable enough for production use in your environment, a 
short notice would be nice, too...).

Happy testing!
Jonas Wolz

Subject: [Yajhfc-announce] YajHFC 0.5.0 release candiate
Message-ID: <201103131325.43327.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

In a few weeks YajHFC 0.5.0 will be released.

You can download the current release candidate as jar file / Windows setup / 
Linux packages / MAC app from:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/beta/

The translations (except German) are still incomplete, but they will be 
updated as soon as they are ready.

Changes in YajHFC 0.5.0:
- Support for local caching of the fax lists, probably making the start-up of 
the application feel much quicker
- Experimental support for direct reading to the recvq and doneq directory, 
bypassing the HylaFAX server (and the HylaFAX user authentication). This 
might lead to a lower server load with large queues since only modified files 
are read to refresh the fax lists. This still needs some testing, however... 
(any feedback on this feature is very welcome!)
- Options dialog should open a bit faster than before
- "Test connection" button in the Options dialog
- Support for multiple servers
- Support for multiple identities
- Lists of faxes can be saved in CSV, HTML or XML format
- Support for configurable keyboard accelerators


If you find any bugs / problems / ... with this version, please let me know.

Have fun and thanks in advance for your feedback!

Jonas Wolz.

Subject: [Yajhfc-announce] YajHFC moves to www.yajhfc.de
Message-ID: <201110151811.00107.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

Because berlios.de will close down on 2011-12-31 YajHFC moves to a new 
location at http://www.yajhfc.de 
Please update your bookmarks accordingly.


The source code repository and issue tracker will now be hosted on Google Code 
at http://code.google.com/p/yajhfc.

The mailing lists will move to Google Groups accordingly.
Current Members of the mailing lists will receive an invitation to join the 
new Groups (but of course it is up to you to join them or not).

You will need a Google account to join the new Groups; if that is an issue for 
you, please let me know.

I will not remove the old content from berlios.de or close the old mailing 
lists before the end of the year; new releases/updates etc. will only be made 
on yajhfc.de, however.

Since the new home page contains a lot of stuff ported from the old one, 
please let me know if you find any dead links or have any questions/feedback 
about this change.


Have fun
Jonas Wolz
