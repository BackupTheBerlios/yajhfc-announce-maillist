Subject: [Yajhfc-announce] Experimental Windows setup.exe
Message-ID: <200703301226.12702.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

In the last days I created an "experimental" Windows setup.exe for YajHFC 
(using InnoSetup).
Download:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_3_2-setup.exe

The probably most useful feature of it is the ability to install a fax printer 
automatically (of course it also installs nice start menu icons ;-) ).
The automatic fax printer installation needs some testing, however (especially 
if it works in Windows Vista).

Currently it has been tested only on test installations of Windows XP and 
2000. Thus, I would be glad to hear some user feedback especially if you have 
any problems with it or (successfully) used it in Windows Vista.

For more information you may also take a look at the homepage at:

Have fun,
Jonas

Subject: [Yajhfc-announce] OpenOffice plugin for YajHFC
Message-ID: <200710102101.09724.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

I created a small OpenOffice plugin that adds a toolbar button to send the 
current document as a fax with YajHFC.

You can download it at:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/download/yajhfc-OO-plugin.zip

Currently it only has been tested with OpenOffice 2.3 in Linux, but it should 
work with other versions/operating systems, too.

If it does not work for you or if you have any feedback about it, please let 
me know.

Have fun,
Jonas
