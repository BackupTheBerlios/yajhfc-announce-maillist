This is the first time there is an "official" beta of YajHFC due to the many 
internal changes this version incorporates. 
There are currently no known bugs, but all users are encouraged to test this 
version in their environment before using it in production (and provide 
feedback if a problem is found).

New features/changes:
- Support for archive directory
- Support to view and send faxes as a single file (in PDF, TIFF or PS format)
- Phone book includes most common fields now
- Support for a tray icon under Java 6
- Improved options dialog
- Improved command line support (YajHFC can now be
used to send faxes without user confirmation)
- Some simple obfuscation for passwords
- Lots of internal code clean up

Subject: [Yajhfc-announce] YajHFC Windows setup with RedmonEE support
Message-ID: <200912241617.28363.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

Because of several recent requests for Terminal server support for the YajHFC 
fax printer, I created a new (experimental) Windows setup that optionally 
uses RedmonEE instead of the "normal" Redmon to implement that printer.

According to its documentation, the fax printer using RedmonEE should work 
flawlessly in terminal server environments, but as I do not have a terminal 
server installation here, I cannot test if this indeed works or if there are 
still problems.

RedmonEE also works on workstation installations of Windows, so you can also 
use it there if you prefer. 
Nevertheless "normal" Redmon will stay default for YajHFC (except when the 
setup is run on a (terminal) server version of Windows), since RedmonEE 
itself is still beta software and only works with 32bit versions of Windows.

If you would like to test the new setup.exe, you can download it from here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-0_4_2a-setup2.exe

To use RedmonEE, simply select the "RedmonEE" option in the "Select 
Components" step of the setup wizard.

If you have any questions/feedback about the new setup.exe, please just write 
me a mail or reply to this posting on the yajhfc-user list.

I would especially like to hear from you if you have tried out the new setup 
on a terminal server environment, so that I know if it works for you or if 
there are still some problems (but of course any other feedback is also very 
welcome!).

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year,
Jonas Wolz
