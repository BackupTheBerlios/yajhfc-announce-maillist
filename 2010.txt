Subject: [Yajhfc-announce] Experimental Debian and Ubuntu packages for YajHFC
Message-ID: <201001031152.49625.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

In the last few days, new .deb packages for YajHFC have been created. 
They have been tested with Debian 5.0 ("Lenny") and Ubuntu 9.1 and probably 
should work with other versions of Debian or Ubuntu, too.

These packages support an easy installation of YajHFC and an automatic 
installation of a "fax printer" in CUPS (just like the Windows setup does for 
Windows).

The packages include a beta version of YajHFC 0.4.3 (and not 0.4.2a), because 
I had to make some extensions to YajHFC in order to support a reliable, 
automatic fax printer creation with CUPS.

While working on the fax printer package, I created a short guide how to 
manually install a fax printer in YajHFC (e.g. if you use a rpm based 
distribution or the packages do not work for you for some other reason).

You can access this guide at:
http://yajhfc.berlios.de/doc/cupsfaxprinter.shtml

A JAR file of the YajHFC 0.4.3beta can be downloaded here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-0_4_3beta1.jar


If you use Debian or Ubuntu and want to try out the packages, the recommended 
way is to add the YajHFC apt repository to your /etc/apt/sources.list. To do 
so, please add the following line to that file (or use some graphical utility 
to edit your package sources...) and do an "apt-get update".

deb ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt stable/

The packages found there should work for both Debian and Ubuntu, so you can 
use the same apt line for both distributuions.

Usually you will receive a warning that my packages are not authenticated 
(since I am not a Debian or Ubuntu maintainer). 
You can either ignore this warning or import my public key and do another 
apt-get update, so that apt knows that I am "trustworthy".
To import the public key, execute the following command in a terminal:

wget -q http://yajhfc.berlios.de/JonasWolz.pub -O - | sudo apt-key add -

After successfully adding the repository, you will have two additional 
packages available:
yajhfc            -- Installs the jar file, a launcher and adds a menu
                     shortcut
yajhfc-faxprinter -- Installs a fax printer in CUPS

You can now install the packages just like any other package for your 
distribution (e.g. by issuing "apt-get install yajhfc-faxprinter").


If you do not want to add my apt repository, you can also manually download 
and install the debs from here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt/stable/yajhfc_0.4.3~beta1-1_all.deb
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt/stable/yajhfc-faxprinter_0.4.3~beta1-1_all.deb


I hope that the packages will work for you (since this is the first time I 
created and published Debian packages...).
If you have any problems or feedback, please write me a mail or to the 
yajhfc-user mailing list.


Have fun and a Happy New Year,
Jonas Wolz

Subject: [Yajhfc-announce] Experimental RPMs for YajHFC available
Message-ID: <201001051502.11501.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

In addition to the Debian/Ubuntu packages, now there are also some RPM 
packages available.
The RPMs were created and tested on openSUSE 11.2.
They probably will also work with older SUSE versions and other RPM based 
distributions, but as I have not tested this, I cannot promise anything (so 
use them at your own risk... ;-) ).

You can download the two packages from:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-0.4.2.99beta1-1.noarch.rpm
and
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-faxprinter-0.4.2.99beta1-1.noarch.rpm

If you have any problems and/or feedback, please write me a mail or to the 
yajhfc-user mailing list.


Have fun,

Is it possible for MS Excel to automatically send parameters to the Yajhfc 
client i.e. Fax Number?

I have Excel templates that have different fax numbers, and it would 
enable me to fax them without having to input the fax number each time.

thanks,
Stephen

The builds at the above URL have been updated with the Chinese, Italian, 
Russian and Spanish translations (thanks to all translators for their fast 
response!).

Subject: [Yajhfc-announce] YajHFC 0.5.0beta
Message-ID: <201012311640.23998.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

A beta version for YajHFC 0.5.0 has been made available today.

You can find it in the following directory:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/beta/

This version incorporates major changes in the architecture the fax lists are 
loaded, which will offer much more flexibility in the possible sources of the 
list data and will probably make it easier to offer multiple server support 
some time in the future (although still much work needs to be done for the 
latter; this feature won't necessarily come with 0.5.0).

Because of this rather major change, I decided to put out a beta early (it 
might still take some months before 0.5.0 gets released).
I will be happy about any positive or negative feedback regarding this change 
(especially new bugs, performance problems, ...).

User-visible changes are:

- Support for local caching of the fax lists, probably making the start-up of 
the application feel much quicker

- Experimental support for direct reading to the recvq and doneq directory, 
bypassing the HylaFAX server (and the HylaFAX user authentication). This 
might lead to a lower server load with large queues since only modified files 
are read to refresh the fax lists. This still needs some testing, however... 
(any feedback on this feature is very welcome!)

- Options dialog should open a bit faster than before

- "Test connection" button in the Options dialog


Happy New Year and happy testing!
Jonas Wolz
